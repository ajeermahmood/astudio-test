# Dummy JSON App

A modern Next.js application built with React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, Axios, Tailwind CSS, and Materialâ€‘UI (MUI).

## Features

  - **Users Page:** Displays user data with filters (Name, Email, Birth Date, Gender), pagination, and client-side search.
  - **Products Page:** Shows product data with filters (Title, Brand, Category), a tab interface (ALL and Laptops), and pagination.
- **Reusable Components:** Common UI components like DataTable, Filters, and Pagination.
- **State Management:** Powered by Redux Toolkit for handling API data and local UI state.
- **API Integration:** Fetches data from [dummyjson.com](https://dummyjson.com).
- **Modern Styling:** Combines Tailwind CSS with MUI for a clean, responsive UI.
- **Custom Font and Theme:** Used Custom font and theme.
